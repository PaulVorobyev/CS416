This is a README for the scheduler assignment.

*Milestone 1*) Scheduling (without implementing synchronization)  
a) Manage contexts  
b) Queue  
c) ~ Multilevel ~ priority queue  

## TODO
* ~~we should have a maintenance cycle for scheduler (as per assignment description)~~
* ~~double check our function defintions in pthread.h are correct (pthread_create seems off)~~
* ~~we need macros for all methods in pthread.h, similar to what we did for myMalloc in 211 (also in assignment description)~~
* ~~possibly improve benchmarker~~ (they just gave us one)
* ~~make better tests~~ the benchamrker they gaves is probably good enough for testing
* free some stuff lol?
